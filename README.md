# Predicting-Emotion-of-Spotify-song-using-NLTK-and-Pyspark

### Problem Statement: 
To identify and analyze the emotional tone of songs using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as sentiment analysis, emotion analysis, and topic modelling, with a focus on the NLTK library. The goal of the project is to develop a framework that can accurately identify and track the emotions conveyed in song lyrics, including happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, and neutral emotions, and to provide insights into the emotional content of different genres of music. The analysis could help with music recommendation systems, content creation, and improving the emotional impact of music.

### Data collection: 
The dataset used for the "Emotional Tone of Songs: An NLTK-based Analysis" project was obtained by querying the Spotify and Musixmatch APIs. The data includes information about songs, such as title, artist, album, release year, and popularity, as well as their associated lyrics.

### Methodlogies:

The following pretrained models are used to predict the emotion of song based on lyrics.
- Text Blod Model
- Vader Sentiment
- BERT
- OpenAI GPT-3
